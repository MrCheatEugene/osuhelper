# osuhelper
osu! helper is a useful tool to automatically change your discord status to DND when you're playing osu! or to online, when you're not!

# Install
1. `git clone https://github.com/MrCheatEugene/osuhelper && cd osuhelper`
2. `npm i`
3. At line 3, insert your discord **user** token. [How to obtain it?](https://googlethatforyou.com?q=how%20to%20obtain%20discord%20token)
4. `node index.js`
5. While index.js rund in the background, it checks if osu! is running or not every half a second.

# This is a userbot!
Or a self-bot, or automated account, whatever. I wanted to use the official discord API for changing the status, but, I couldn't find any methods to change user's status using Bot API or official OAUTH Api. So, for now it's a userbot, and please read the disclaimer below!

# Disclaimer
THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ppy Pty Ltd AND IT IS NOT OFFICIAL SOFTWARE RELEASED BY osu! OR ppy Pty Ltd!
Also, Discord [doesn't like userbots](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-), so be careful!
